# ShallowRed
Fantasy football app (i.e. the only way I'll consider playing)

Major portions of the code was based on this repo: https://github.com/ykeuter/ffl and major inspiration was taken from their medium article: https://towardsdatascience.com/using-monte-carlo-tree-search-for-your-fantasy-football-draft-6509b78a1c20

Projections mostly stolen from https://g.espncdn.com/s/ffldraftkit/23/NFLDK2023_CS_ClayProjections2023.pdf?adddata=2023CS_ClayProjections2023 (is Mike Clay the best perfromance predictor? Who cares, it was much easier for me to create dataframes from a pdf than to relearn beautifulsoup to scrape down from other websites).

Feel free to clone the repo and use it to win (or lose) your fantasy football leagues. When starting a draft you will have to enter all picks but I've included a sim option if you want a strategy for setting and forgetting your preffered auto draft strategy.

Also, I'm pretty lame, the name of the repo is a reference to deep blue, the ibm chess engine that beat Kasparov.
